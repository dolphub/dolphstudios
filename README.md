# NodePong
This is an n-screen configurable pong application that is designed to run on parallel displayed computers where each screen (browser) can phsyically be beside eachother.  The ball will bounce around the court which can be any number of screens wide or tall, and the users will connect into the server via mobile browser and control the paddles with their phones.
